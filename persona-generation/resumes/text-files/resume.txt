WORK EXPERIENCE
Research Assistant - NASA-Collaborative Robotics & AI | ARCS Lab, CSUN Ongoing
• Developed autonomous navigation systems for NASA rover prototypes using ROS2 and 
reinforcement learning.
• Engineered a generative AI pipeline (GANs, PyTorch) to simulate Martian terrain for NASA 
missions.
• Designed a computer vision module (OpenCV, YOLOv8) to identify mission-critical landmarks.
Intern - Data Scientist | India Space Research Organization (ISRO) Jan 2024 - May 2024
• Developed ML models to detect mineral deposits in oceans using satellite data.
• Engineered rainfall prediction models using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
• Automated data preprocessing pipelines with Python, reducing cleaning time.
Intern - Machine Learning Developer | Nxon AI Pvt. Ltd. May 2022 - Nov 2023 • Created an LSTM-based stock price prediction model (Python, TensorFlow).
• Developed and fine-tuned LLM-based question-answering systems using Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation (RAG) pipelines for domain-specific applications.
• Integrated APIs and automated data ingestion workflows using Python, Selenium, and LangChain, 
optimizing performance across the pipeline.
PROJECTS
Legal Chatbot for Washington State Law
• Created a RAG-based legal assistant using OpenAI and LLaMA models to answer questions based 
on Washington state legal documents.
• Implemented document ingestion using LangChain, SQL, and vector databases to retrieve 
context-specific answers with source references, simplifying access to legal information for non￾technical users.
AI Assistant for Doctors and Patients
• Developed an AI assistant using Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide treatment suggestions 
and doctor recommendations.
YouTube Video Summarizer
• Built a tool using Haystack, OpenAI LLM, and Whisper transcriber to summarize YouTube videos, 
reducing viewing time by 30 minutes per user.
